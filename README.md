# InternalAuditValidationSystem Crew

Welcome to the InternalAuditValidationSystem Crew project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). This template is designed to help you set up a multi-agent AI system with ease, leveraging the powerful and flexible framework provided by crewAI. Our goal is to enable your agents to collaborate effectively on complex tasks, maximizing their collective intelligence and capabilities.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.14 installed on your system. This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

First, if you haven't already, install uv:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Next, navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies:

(Optional) Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command:
```bash
crewai install
```
### Customizing

**Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` into the `.env` file**

- Modify `src/internal_audit_validation_system/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents
- Modify `src/internal_audit_validation_system/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks
- Modify `src/internal_audit_validation_system/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools and specific args
- Modify `src/internal_audit_validation_system/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks

## Running the Project

To kickstart your crew of AI agents and begin task execution, run this from the root folder of your project:

```bash
$ crewai run
```

This command initializes the internal_audit_validation_system Crew, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in your configuration.

This example, unmodified, will run the create a `report.md` file with the output of a research on LLMs in the root folder.

## Understanding Your Crew

The internal_audit_validation_system Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to achieve complex objectives. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in your crew.

## Evaluating Task Quality

Use the evaluation harness to identify which task is degrading the overall crew output. Supply the markdown generated by each agent in a JSON payload that follows the structure in `evaluation/sample_payload.json`, then run:

```bash
python -m internal_audit_validation_system.evaluation.runner \
  --input-json evaluation/sample_payload.json \
  --write-report evaluation/latest_report.json
```

The CLI prints a per-task pass rate across structural checks (table format, mandatory sections, readiness verdicts, etc.) and writes detailed findings to the optional report. Failing checks highlight missing sections so you can zero in on the responsible task. Integrate this step into your pipeline by exporting each task’s markdown after a crew run and feeding it to the evaluator.
